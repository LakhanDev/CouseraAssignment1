# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple calculator program that calculates the simple interest based on the provided principal amount, time period in years, and annual rate of interest.

## Inputs

- **p**: Principal amount (initial investment or loan amount).
- **t**: Time period in years (duration for which the principal amount is borrowed or invested).
- **r**: Annual rate of interest (percentage of the principal amount that is charged or received as interest).

## Output

- **Simple Interest**: The total interest earned or paid based on the provided principal amount, time period, and annual interest rate.

## Formula Used

The formula used to calculate simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = p \times t \times r \]

Where:
- \( p \) = Principal amount
- \( t \) = Time period in years
- \( r \) = Annual rate of interest (as a decimal)

## Usage

To use this calculator:
1. Input the values for \( p \), \( t \), and \( r \).
2. The program will calculate the simple interest based on the provided inputs.
3. The result will be displayed as the total interest earned or paid.

## Example

For example, if:
- \( p = 1000 \) (principal amount)
- \( t = 3 \) years (time period)
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% annual interest rate)

The simple interest would be calculated as:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 1000 \times 3 \times 0.05 = 150 \]

Therefore, the simple interest earned or paid would be \( \$150 \).
